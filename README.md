VR-Based Peripheral Vision Test

A Virtual Reality Approach to Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease

This project implements a peripheral vision testing framework designed to support early biomarker research for Alzheimer’s disease.
It presents randomized grayscale shapes at far-peripheral angles (31°–100°) and records user responses to evaluate visual awareness, reaction timing, and perceptual accuracy.

Phase 1 provides a desktop full-screen simulation.
Phase 2 will transition the system to VR headsets for immersive and standardized testing.

Features

Full-screen peripheral stimulus presentation

Randomized grayscale circle stimuli at controlled eccentricities

User registration and automatic session logging

Reaction time and accuracy tracking

Data export for statistical analysis

Streamlit-based interactive application included

Planned support for VR headsets (Quest, Vive, etc.)

Research Context

This project is part of a broader research effort supervised by:

Dr. Chiquito Crasto
Research Associate Professor
Center for Biotechnology and Genomics
Texas Tech University

The long-term goal is to evaluate whether visual-field processing deficits can act as early, non-invasive indicators of Alzheimer’s disease, using VR technology to ensure reproducible visual testing.
