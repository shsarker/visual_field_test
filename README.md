# VR-Based Peripheral Vision Test
### A Virtual Reality Approach to Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease

This project implements a peripheral vision testing framework designed to support early biomarker research for Alzheimer’s disease.  
It presents randomized grayscale shapes at far-peripheral angles (31°–100°) and records user responses to evaluate visual awareness, reaction timing, and perceptual accuracy.

Phase 1 provides a desktop full-screen simulation.  
Phase 2 will transition the system to VR headsets for immersive and standardized testing.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a reproducible digital method to measure far-peripheral visual field performance  
- Explore whether peripheral vision response patterns can serve as early biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease  
- Build a platform suitable for future clinical-research integration, VR deployment, and quantitative analysis

## Features
- Full-screen peripheral stimulus presentation  
- Randomized grayscale circle stimuli at controlled eccentricities  
- User registration and automatic session logging  
- Reaction time and accuracy tracking  
- Data export for statistical analysis  
- Streamlit-based interactive application included  
- Planned support for VR headsets (Quest, Vive, etc.)

## Research Context
This project is part of a broader research effort supervised by:

**Dr. Chiquito Crasto**  
Research Associate Professor  
Center for Biotechnology and Genomics  
Texas Tech University  

The long-term goal is to evaluate whether visual-field processing deficits can act as early, non-invasive indicators of Alzheimer’s disease using VR technology.
